    I remember asking you about the black floaters in my eyes, and you gave me a serious answer.\
    I also shared what caused them.\
    Then I asked you what made you swipe right on me, and you mentioned that you were bored and did a massive swipe right.\
    I thanked you because that gave me the chance to get to know you better.\
    \
    As time went by, I grew attached to you on Bumble‚Äîto the point that I started looking for your attention every day, even poking you.\
    I asked if it was okay to add you on Instagram or Messenger.\
    You said you were still hesitant, which I completely understood.\
    But you also said, \"Pero kung magiging part ka naman soon ng loved ones, why not?\"\
    That made me start to like you‚Äîand eventually, fall in love with you.\
    \
    The more I got to know you, the more I discovered hidden qualities that weren't on your Bumble profile‚Äîqualities that made me fall for you even more.\
    You didn‚Äôt judge me for liking anime or see me as a nerd or a creep.\
    In fact, you liked it too."

      you because it genuinely made me happy.\
      We also talked about things like you not wanting a boyfriend, your fears about marriage, and even deeper \
      topics like politics, religion, and kindness. I understood your worries back then‚Äîand through those \
      conversations, I came to love you even more for who you truly are. \
      Back then, I told you that even if you weren‚Äôt interested, \
      I was willing to quietly support you from the shadows‚Äîbecause from the way we talked, \
      I could already see that you had a genuinely good heart." },

\
We even played ML together, even if it was just classic mode since we had different ranks. I wanted to stick with you and be cool, but we still lost haha.\
\
When I got home, our conversations continued. I know I was a bit annoying back then for asking about your past relationship‚Äîit made me a little jealous, and I think that may have led you to delete Telegram. But even after that, you reached out to me, apologizing and saying I was nice.\
\
And from there, our conversations became even deeper‚Äîbeyond just relationships. We talked about how we‚Äôre growing as adults, and you listened and understood so openly. That meant a lot to me." },

I‚Äôll never forget what you said: \"Alagaan mo muna sarili mo kasi wala pa ako sa tabi mo para gawin 'yan.\" That really stayed with me.

I also learned how to drive so that when we finally meet in person, I can be the one to pick you up‚Äîmaybe through Grab at first‚Äîbut eventually, I‚Äôll be the one driving if you're using your car.\n\nI really appreciate the K-dramas you recommended, like Hi Bye, Mama and Heavenly Ever After. I haven‚Äôt watched Heavenly Ever After yet, but Hi Bye, Mama really struck me‚Äîthe way it balanced drama and warmth was so beautiful.\n\nI hope someday we can watch random shows together, just relaxing and enjoying each other's company.\n\nAnd of course, I‚Äôll never forget when you told me that it feels light just knowing I play with my pets‚Äîand especially with GooGoo, your crushie cakes.

On July 17, we moved our conversations to Messenger. On the day of my friend‚Äôs wedding, I told myself I wanted to look good so I could send you a photo. And when I did, you told me I looked pogi‚Äîthat meant so much to me. Back then, I promised there was no third party, and if there was any way I could prove how serious I was, I would. Even though you told me you were strong and independent, I still wanted to care for you‚Äîgenuinely and deeply. Then came July 22, a Sunday. We talked about you wanting a boy cut, and I told you to go for it if that would make you happy‚Äîbecause I‚Äôd support you in every way I could. Honestly, I felt a little sad when you mentioned liking girls‚Äînot because I judged you, but because by then, I was already really into you. You noticed I was a bit down and hit me with the song ‚ÄúRuin My Life.‚Äù Later, I asked you what your 'yes' meant‚ÄîI was confused. But when I confirmed you liked me too, I swear I felt like the happiest person alive. ‚ô•Ô∏è Then you called me slow‚Äîand I really am! You even gave me the nickname 'Slow na BF' ‚ú®. I‚Äôve kept that nickname ever since, because it came from you. And the way you said it made it feel special."
